## Issues:
* If a product quantity is negative (return) but there is no postive product to match it with
   the inventory should hand them correctly. (Possible solution: Recode them as positive stock and negative price)
* Add support different levels of R reminder to allow the solve to find an optimal solution
* Add output message/status to the commands
* Add column selection configs
* Extract solver configs
* Do I need to change the assignment percentages?
